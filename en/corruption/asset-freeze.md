title: Asset freeze

An asset freeze, also known as a freezing order, is when an individual or a company's bank accounts or financial assets are blocked, and cannot be used outside of their jurisdiction.

These individuals or companies are also blocked from banking in the jurisdiction that is freezing their assets, or using any financial services that belong to that jurisdiction. Asset freezes are usually used by a government or governing authority to punish an individual or company for misconduct or for a crime.
