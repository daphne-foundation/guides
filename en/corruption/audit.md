An audit is an inspection of a person's or company's accounts, typically conducted by an independent person or organisation. An internal audit of a company's or public body's accounts is carried out by an employee of that company or body.

Any kind of audit, even a forensic audit, is not equivalent to and can not substitute a criminal investigation, as auditors do not have any powers beyond those of a normal, private person, and can only base their work on material provided by the person or company whose accounts they are auditing.
