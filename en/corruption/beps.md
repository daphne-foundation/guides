title: Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
---

BEPS is the strategy used by multinational corporations that exploits gaps in tax regulation between countriues, in order to avoid or pay less taxes than they should.

The strategy is expensive to implement and complicated to manage. This means that it is out of reach of most people and companies, putting them at an unfair, ever-worsening structural disadvantage to extremely wealthy people and large corporations.

BEPS is a form of agressive tax avoidance, as businesses that operate across different borders are able to legally move their business to low-tax jurisdictions.

## Apple

Apple registered its EU office in Ireland due to the low business taxes there. In 2020 the European Commission [brought a case](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53416206) against Apple, claiming that the company had been avoiding taxes.
