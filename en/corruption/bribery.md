title: Bribery

Bribery is when an individual uses goods, services, or anything of value, to influence another person and get a desired outcome from them.

The most important thing to remember is that *it takes two to tango*. In all countries, it is a crime for a public official to **ask for or accept** a bribe and for somone to **offer or give** a bribe to an official. This is called public sector bribery or public sector corruption.

In many countries it is also a crime for someone who is not a public official to accept or ask for a bribe, and for someone to bribe or attempt to bribe a person who is not an official. This is called private sector bribery or private sector corruption.

In an example of possible attempted bribery in the private sector, the Maltese lawyer Gianluca Caruana Curran is accused of attempted to bribe a journalist to produce reporting that is favourable to his client. For more detailed information about that case, read the Foundation's [explanation](https://www.daphne.foundation/en/2020/11/05/bribing-a-journalist) as to why attempted bribery is a crime.
