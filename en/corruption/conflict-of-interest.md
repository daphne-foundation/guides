title: Conflict of interest
---

A conflict of interest exists when an individual or corporation has the opportunity to exploit their position for personal or corporate benefit, as opposed to the benefit of the person whose interests they are being trusted to serve. Conflict of interests are often understood as the root cause of corruption.

An example of a conflict of interest is an employee awarding a contract to a company which he or she has a financial interest in.

## Case study: the energy minister's lawyer

Malta has had many previous conflict of interest scandals. Konrad Mizzi [appointed his personal lawyer](https://theshiftnews.com/2020/04/30/konrad-mizzis-personal-lawyer-was-the-advisor-he-took-to-seal-montenegro-deal/) Aron Mifsud Bonici, who defends the former energy minister against serious allegations of corruption, to the board of Enemalta, the state power utility. The lawyer's position on the board of the utility obliges him to protect that utility from potential corruption and to uncover as well as recover the damage caused by the same corruption that his client is accused of.
