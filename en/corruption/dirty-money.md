Dirty money is money obtained in an illegal way. That includes money obtained as a result of [embezzlement]({% link en/corruption/embezzlement.md %}), [bribery]({% link en/corruption/bribery.md %}) and [kickback]({% link en/corruption/kickback.md %}) schemes, forgery, trafficking, prositution, illegal gambling or straightforward theft at gunpoint.

The process of *cleaning* dirty money, making it seem as though it was obtained in a legal way, is called [money-laundering]({% link en/corruption/money-laundering.md %}).
