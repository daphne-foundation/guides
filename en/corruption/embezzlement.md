title: Embezzlement
---

Embezzlement is a type of financial crime. It occurs when a person takes money or property that has been entrusted to their care and uses it to pay for something that they were not supposed to pay for.

## Example: the social media campaign

Every minister in a government is granted $1 million each year to spend on a campaign advertising the policies of their ministry. The energy ministry is expected to spend the money entrusted to it on a campaign to promote a reduction in energy use. Instead of explaining to people that they should not leave the air conditioning on when they leave their house, the ministry spends the money on a campaign to descredit reports of government corruption.

In this case, the energy ministry has *wrongfully applied* public funds. That is the definition of embezzlement.

## Example: the landlord minister

The minister of tourism in a government wants to buy an expensive Christmas gift for his girlfriend. He holds a bank account with his wife and if he were to withdraw money from it to pay for the gift, his wife would notice. The minister [uses his girlfriend as a proxy]({% link en/corruption/proxy.md %}) to sign a lease agreement, renting an office in her name for $1,000 per month, from an estate agency. He then intructs the officials in his ministry to lease the same office from his girlfriend for $10,000 per month, saying that it is needed to host a new unit of his ministry's staff. The staff would [never be hired]({% link en/corruption/ghost-employee.md %}) and the office would remain empty. With the money paid to her in rent after a few months the minister's girlfriend buys an expensive car. The rental agreement is eventually cancelled and the paperwork destroyed. In this way, the minister has embezzled public funds to his girlfriend a car.
