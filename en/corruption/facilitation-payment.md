title: Facilitation payment
---

The phrase **facilitation payment** is a euphemism for a small [bribe]({% link en/corruption/bribery.md %}) used to speed up or secure a service which an individual or company is entitled to.

Small bribes are commonly demanded in certain transactions or activities, typically in travel, logistics or seeking approval of some kind such as a visa, licence, certificate, utility service or regulatory approval.

In countries such as Bangladesh, where corruption is rampant, any kind of encounter with a public official, even for a mundane activity such as obtaining corporate filings from a public registry, could be expected to involve the solicitation of a bribe, which the official soliciting it claims will 'facilitate' the process.
