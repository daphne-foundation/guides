A free-trade zone is a geographical area in a country that benefits from different tax rules, or tax exemptions. It is usually used by criminals to transport illegal goods, as rules are often not enforced or import and export duties will not apply in that specific area.

Free-trade zones that offer company incoporation and banking services to non-residents are akin to an [offshore jurisdiction]({% link en/corruption/offshore-jurisdiction.md %}). As the free-trade are not located in areas where anyone would want to physically operate a business, the services is primarily used for the incorporation of [shell companies]({% link en/corruption/shell-company.md %}).
