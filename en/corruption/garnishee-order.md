title: Garnishee order
---

A **garnishee order** is a kind of warrant issued by a court, usually at the request of a creditor who is attempting to collect a debt. When someone owes something, usually money, to someone else, the person who *owes* the money is the debtor and the person who is *owed* the money is the creditor.

The order is issued to any person or organisation that is likely to hold money or personal property on behalf of the debtor. Typically, this means mainstream banks, as those are where most people keep their money.

If a company or a person does not pay for something they bought, or if they do not repay money they borrowed, the creditor may file a claim in court asking the court to transfer to them anything of value owned by the debtor, until the debt is paid. If the creditor is worried that once they file the claim, the debtor will run away with all their money, the creditor may ask the court for a *precautionary* garnishee order.

If the precautionary garnishee order is issued to a bank, it would force the bank to *garnish*, that is to sequester, or isolate, any of the debtor's earnings that are deposited in any of their accounts at the bank up to the amount they owe. The earnings remain at the bank but are frozen and cannot be moved or used by any person until the court rules otherwise.

If the court decides that the debt is indeed owed to the creditor, the *precautionary* garnishee order is converted into an *executive* warrant. In the case of an order issued to a bank, that would mean that the sequestered, or frozen, deposits are paid by the bank to the creditor.

In Malta, a garnishee order is known as a *mandat ta' sekwestru*. It is often confused with a [warrant of seizure]({% link en/corruption/warrant-of-seizure.md %}) (*mandat ta' qbid*) and [warrant of prohibitory injunction]({% link en/corruption/warrant-of-prohibitory-injunction.md %}) (*mandat ta' inibizzjoni*).
