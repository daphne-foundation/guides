A **ghost employee**, **ghost contractor**, **phantom employee** or **phantom contractor** is a real or fictional person who is employed or contracted to perform a service for a company or public body without ever turning up for work or doing any of the work specified in their contract. It is a kind of [fraud]({% link en/corruption/fraud.md %}) that is often used to facilitate [embezzlement]({% link en/corruption/embezzlement.md %}).

In an embezzlement scheme, a senior public official might offer a contract of employment to someone whom they owe money to.  The creditor signs the contract of employment on the understanding that their performance will not be monitored and they will not be asked to turn up for work. In this way, the official's debt is paid to their creditor out of public funds, in the form of a government salary for work that is never done.

Journalists were unable to find any evidence that the accountant had done any work for the ministry. The Minister of Justice, Owen Bonnici, was unable to explain what the government had received in exchange for the salary paid to Brian Tonna.
