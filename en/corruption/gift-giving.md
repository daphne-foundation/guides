title: Gift giving

The **giving or recieving gifts** is a legal activity. However, gift giving often crosses into the territory of [bribery]({% link en/corruption/bribery.md %}).

In Malta, there are laws that limit gift giving in the public sector, in order to avoid corruption. In the Public Administration Act, public employees or board members are instructed to refuse any gifts, payments or compensation.

## Case study: Bulgari watches and expensive wine for a prime minister

Joseph Muscat was ‘gifted’ a limited edition Bulgari watch, with an estimated value of €12,000 to €17,000 by Yorgen Fenech.  Fenech also [gave Muscat](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/activists-want-muscat-investigated-over-yorgen-fenechs-watch-gift.759338) three bottles of Pétrus, a Bordeaux red wine, valued at €5,000 each.

Since the gifts were not disclosed they have [raised questions](https://theshiftnews.com/2020/01/26/gift-giving-and-bribery-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/) on the ethics of giving gifts, particularly with Fenech's suspected involvement in the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, but also in his previous role as director of Electrogas.
