This is a glossary of key terms relating to corruption, written in [plain English](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/11/propublica-experiments-with-ultra-accessible-plain-language-in-stories-about-disabilities/). It is a work in progress.

The glossary was first written by Azzurra Moores and Sabriyah Saeed at The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation.

Our goal is to explain the nuts and bolts of corruption in an easy-to-understand, accessible way.

You'll find descriptions here that straddle both the legal and illegal. This is because the legal systems created and used by financial professionals are used both by criminal organisations and normal ones that engage in agressive tax avoidance. In most cases it is impossible to determine whether some mechanisms were originally created to serve one or the other.

The line is blurry and we hope we have been able to produce text that allows people to make up their own minds.
