title: Kickback
---

Think of a game of football. One player passes the ball to another player and that player **kicks** the ball **back** to them.

In the context of corruption the word *kickback* is used in the phrase **kickback scheme**. This is because a kickback involves two or more people conspiring, or *scheming*, for one or more of them to receive preferential treatment or some kind of service that they are not supposed to receive. The people who receive the improper service then *kick* some of the profit that they made after receiving that improper service *back* to the people who gave it to them.

A kickback usually involves someone buying something and another person selling it. The buyer agrees to pay a higher price than usual to the seller or to choose one seller instead of another. After the buyer pays the seller, the seller *kicks back* some of the profit they made back to the buyer. Because the buyer is losing money, kickback schemes usually involve *representatives* of buyers who hide the scheme from the actual buyer. This element of deceit or breach of trust is important in any kickback scheme.

## Example: the pasta restaurant

Imagine you own a pasta restaurant. Every week your cook buys a crate of dry spaghetti from any one of the different companies that sell it. The cook is supposed to buy the crate of dry spaghetti from the company that is selling it at the lowest price, take it back to the restaurant and keep it there so that the spaghetti can be cooked and served to customers.

One day, one of the companies that sells pasta tells your cook that if they buy a crate of pasta from that company for $1,000 instead of one of the others selling a crate for $900, the company will give the cook $50. The cook tells you that the cheapest pasta he can buy that week costs $1,000 and you trust him, so you write a cheque to the company for $1,000. The company keeps $950 for itself and gives $50 to the chef, along with the crate of pasta.

In this example, the company and your cook made $50 each. Your restaurant has lost $100 because if it were not for the kickback scheme, it would have paid $900 for the pasta instead of $1,000. This is why a kickback scheme involves an *improper* service, because the extra profit is obtained through deceit, by tricking people, and not in a proper, honest way.

Now imagine if the next week, the cook is feeling guilty and tells the company they schemed with last week that they do not want to do the same thing again. The company threatens to expose the cook to you, the restaurant owner, and make it seem as though the scheme was the cook's idea. The company would tell you that it only went along with the scheme because the cook threatened them with violence. The cook knows that you are a friend of the company owner and that you would believe the company's story, so the cook repeats the scheme every week, because they are afraid of losing their job.

## Example: the political party

The buyer in a kickback scheme is not always an individual. It could be a big group of people or a large organisation that manages money on behalf of another person. When you pay taxes, you are entrusting the government to spend that money properly on your behalf. Imagine that a political party borrows $1 million from a company that sells gas, called Blowcar Trading. The party uses this money to advertise pro-environment policies that make it popular. When the party is elected and forms a government, the new prime minister decides to cancel the previous government's order for solar panels and instead orders the construction of power plant that burns gas to generate electricity. The government chooses Blowcar Trading to build the power plant and supply the gas that it will burn. Over the next ten years, Blowcar Trading makes a profit of $10 million as a result of this deal with the government. The party never pays back the loan from Blowcar Trading and the company never asks it to.

In this example, the element of deceit or breach of trust is that the government is not using the money you have paid in taxes properly. Members of the governing party conspired with Blowcar Trading to buy gas from that company, *kicking back* more money than Blowcar Trading loaned the party. In return the company would not ask the party to pay back the loan that the party used to pay for an avertising campaign. Both the party and the company have gained from the scheme, at the expense of the public.
