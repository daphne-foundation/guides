title: Kompromat
---

Kompromat is compromising material about a public figure, or any person in a position of power, authority or influence, used to blackmail or manipulate them into doing another person or company's bidding, typically using the threat of public exposure.

The term originates from Russia, where *kompromat* is short for "compromising material". Historical examples of kompromat used in Russia include the use of prostitutes, hired by the KGB to entrap senior politicians, with photographs and videos then used as a form of blackmail.

Kompromat can be discovered by an adversary of a public figure, for example through a process of [opposition research]({% link en/corruption/opposition-research.md %}), for the purpose of exposing them without manipulating them, or by those seeking to use the compromising material to manipulate them by threatening to expose the material. It can also be engineered in a scheme that the adversary or blackmailer conceives in advance. A company could bribe a newspaper's owner, so that if the newspaper discovers that company's much larger bribe to a politician, the company owner would then be able to blackmail the newspaper's owner into stopping publication of the report, using the threat of exposing the prior bribe taken by the newspaper owner.

Some [reputation management]({% link en/corruption/reputation-management.md %}) firms, such as [Schillings]({% link en/corruption/schillings.md %}), offer the service of [reverse due diligence]({% link en/corruption/reverse-due-diligence.md %}), which is the process of collecting potentially compromising material on their clients so that the risk of it being used as kompromat can be mitigated.
