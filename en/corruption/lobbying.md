title: Lobbying
---

Lobbying is when an organisation, an individual or group of individuals try to influence government officials, usually in their policies or decisions. 

This type of influencing of government officials is legal and considered a form of advocacy. Lobbying is usually illegal when it involves an exchange of favours, money or goods.

## Example: public interest

Advocacy groups may engage in lobbying with government officials to encourage them to adopt policies that are in the public interest.

An example of lobbying that The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation has undertaken is in the campaign to create a public inquiry to investigate the death of Daphne. The family held meetings with the Prime Minister and raised the profile of the campaign.

## Example: private interest

According to the law, property developers have to make sure that the buildings they build are strong enough to remain standing after a small earthquake. The law makes building a block of apartments more expensive than it was before, but safer for the residents.

A group of property developers that wants to make more money might lobby the government to change the law so that buildings do not have to be safe. The government knows that this would make buildings unsafe, but because the property developers donated money to the prime minister's election campaign, the government changes the law.

The property developers make more money, but people who live in apartments are more likely to die or be injured in an earthquake.
