Money laundering is the process of making large amounts of money that have been obtained illegally appear as if they have been obtained legally. This may be money, known as "dirty money", that has been obtained through fraud, theft, embezzlement, or other means of corruption.  

There are three stages of money laundering: placement, layering and integration.

The first stage, the placement stage, puts the dirty money into a legitimate financial system, such as a bank. This allows the money to be easily moveable. The second stage in the layering stage, which is typically used to hide the origin of the money. This involves "layering" the money through different transactions, often to offshore accounts. The final stage of money laundering is the stage of intergration. This final stage is used to make it seem as though the money has been originally obtained from a legitimate source, making it difficult to detect what is "dirty money" and what is money that has been obtained legally. 

Money laundering often occurs through buisnesses with a high cash turn-over, such as the hospitality industry.
