title: Offshore company

Any company with a special no or low tax status granted on the understanding that it conducts its business elsewhere is an **offshore company**. Not all shell companies are offshore companies and not all offshore companies are shell companies. An offshore company might conduct meaningful, legitimate economic activity, employ staff and operate out of a physical office. This is rarely the case.
