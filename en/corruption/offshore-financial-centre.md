Offshore financial centres are [offshore jurisdictions]({% link en/corruption/offshore-jurisdiction.md %}) whose financial services attract a significant number of non-residents. The reason for this is that the jurisdiction usually has very low on no tax rates combined with no or [light-touch]({% link en/corruption/light-touch-regulation.md %}) regulation, access to [offshore banking]({% link en/corruption/offshore-banking.md %}) services and [shell company]({% link en/corruption/shell-company.md %}) incorporation for non-residents.

These offshore financial centres often attract corrupt activity, since the governments of these areas tend to not monitor them closely. Offshore financial centres can also be referred to as [tax havens]({% link en/corruption/tax-haven.md %}) although some tax havens are not sigificant enough to be classed as offshore financial *centres*.

When an offshore financial centre makes it difficult or impossible to get any information on financial activity in that jurisdiction, it is also [secrecy havens]({% link en/corruption/secrecy-haven.md %}).

The activity of a [free-trade zones]({% link en/corruption/free-trade-zone.md %}) that offer company incorporation or banking services to non-residents, making it an offshore jurisdiction in its own right, may be significant enough to be classed as an offshore financial centre.

Examples of offshore financial centres are: Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey and Barbados.
