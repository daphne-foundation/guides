title: Offshore jurisdiction
---

An offshore jurisdiction offers [offshore company]({% link en/corruption/offshore-company.md %}) incorporation and often also [offshore banking]({% link en/corruption/offshore-banking.md %}) services to non-residents as a central economic activity of the jurisdiction. It is combined with an offering of low or no tax for companies owned by non-residents or companies that conduct their economic activity outside of the offshore jurisdiction. In this sense, offshore jurisdictions are also [tax havens]({% link en/corruption/tax-haven.md %}).

Those jurisdictions that do not make corporate filings [readily available]({% link en/corruption/ready-availability.md %}), or do not oblige companies to file any kind of documentation on their status, legal composition or activity, or that even criminalise the disclosure of such information, are said to be [secrecy havens]({% link en/corruption/secrecy-haven.md %}).

Offshore jurisdictions or cities within offshore jurisdictions with a large share of the global market are classified as offshore financial centres. Along with company incorporation and banking services, financial centres offer other services commomly found in large cities, such as corporate law firms and the presence of [Big Four accounting firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms). Nue, for example, is an offshore jurisdiction but it is not significant enough to qualify as an offshore financial centre.

[Free trade zones]({% link en/corruption/free-trade-zone.md %}) that offer offshore financial services such as company incorporation are akin to an offshore jurisdiction.
