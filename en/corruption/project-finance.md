title: Project finance
---

**Project finance** is a funding method for long-term projects, which can be infrastructural (for example, roads and railways), industrial, or a public service. The money loaned to the company responsible for the project is paid back from the profits that the project will produce.

For example, if a company uses project financing to build a motorway, they will pay back the loan only once the motorway has been built and starts to make money through tolls.
