A **proxy** or **frontman** is a person used by another person, usually a [politically exposed person]({% link en/corruption/politically-exposed-person.md %}) or someone with a [conflict of interest]({% link en/corruption/conflict-of-interest.md %}), to perform a role in or operate a criminal activity for their benefit.

Suppose the managing director of a newspaper publisher holds shares in paper manufacturing company. The managing director might transfer ownership of the shares to their father, then proceed to, on behalf of the newspaper, place a large order for paper with manufacturer. To an [internal auditor]({% link en/corruption/audit.md %}) at the newspaper who does not recognise the name of the magaging director's father when looking at the manufacturer's corporate filings, it might not seem as though there is a conflict of interest.

A politician might ask their wife or husband to to register a yacht in their name, even though the politician is paying for it, as the politician's name would attract attention when the yacht is registered and they are unable to show that the money used to buy the yacht comes was earned legally.

Some proxies may be used to perform this activity without their knowledge. The settlor of a trust could declare their young children as beneficiaries of the trust, the proceed to settle [dirty money]({% link en/corruption/dirty-money.md %}) into a bank account held in the trust.

A [nominee]({% link en/corruption/nominee-shareholder.md %}) or **straw man** describes a more formal proxy-like arrangement. Nominee shareholders and directors are typically not familiar to the person they are standing in for and are instead contracted by a law firm or company to perform this role for many different clients or in many different [shell companies]({% link en/corruption/shell-company.md %}). The arrangement by which the nominee holds a shares or a directorship on behalf of someone else is usually governed by a power-of-attorney agreement.
