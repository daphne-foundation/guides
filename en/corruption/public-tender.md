title: Public tender
---

A tender is a formal invitation to bid for large business projects. It generates competing offers from different potential suppliers and contractors. Invitations from governments are called **public tenders**.

In an environment of [state capture]({% link en/corruption/state-capture.md %}) and weak [rule of law]({% link en/corruption/rule-of-law.md %}), tenders are more prone to corruption than usual. In a [kleptocracy]({% link en/corruption/kleptocracy.md %}) it is possible for all public tenders to be awarded corruptly.

Strong public tendering systems are transparent, with all or most documentation [readily available]({% link en/corruption/ready-availability.md %}) to the public, designed to withstand [trading in influence]({% link en/corruption/trading-in-influence.md %}) and [kickback]({% link en/corruption/kickback.md %}) schemes.
