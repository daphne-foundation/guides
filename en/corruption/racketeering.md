title: Racketeering
---

Racketeering is when an organised group runs illegal businesses, known as rackets. Criminal operations such as illegal gambling, prostitution rings, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, embezzlement, and extortion, are all examples of rackets.

The defining characteristic of a racket is that the illegal behaviour is repetitive. For example, a bank teller who, acting alone, solicits a [small bribe]({% link en/corruption/facilitation-payment.md %}) to speed up a transfer for a customer has committed a crime but is not operating a racket.

That bank teller could blackmail all other tellers at the bank, using the threat of violence or the promise of a share of illicit proceeds, into soliciting bribes from every customer. The repitition and scale of that illegal activity would make it a racket.

## Case study: political parties in Malta

A major racket in Malta is the [pay-to-play]({% link en/corruption/pay-to-play.md %}) racket operated by political parties, in particular whichever is in government at the time.

One-off donations solicited by political parties in exchange for a promise of preferential treatment or a [change in the law]({% link en/corruption/lobbying.md %}) happen even in the most advanced and transparent democracies where, hopefully, they are exposed.

What makes Malta different is the scale and repitition of the illegal activity, especially [trading in influence]({% link en/corruption/trading-in-influence.md %}), by officials. The two mainstream political parties operate costly broadcasting operations and large offices with numerous staff who are not often [picked for their efficiency]({% link en/corruption/nepotism.md %}). Staff of the parties, or government officials who are members of the party or who campaign for it, solicit 'donations' to the party, services or consumable goods in kind, or the payment of bills on behalf of the party. In return, the person or company being solicited is promised a [direct order]({% link en/corruption/direct-order.md %}), a favourable outcome in a bid for a [public tender]({% link en/corruption/public-tender.md %}) or a valuable [concession]({% link en/corruption/concession.md %}).

The Foundation advocates for the introduction of a laws, similar to the [RICO Act]({% link en/corruption/rico-act.md %}), that would criminalise racketeering of this kind.
