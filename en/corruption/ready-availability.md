title: Ready availability
---

**Ready availability of information** is a phrase we use at the Foundation to distinguish between information that is said to be available but can only be obtained with great expense or difficulty and information that is easy to obtain.

For example, a government can claim that information on company ownership in its jurisdiction is 'available to the public' and that an accusation of being a [secrecy jurisdiciton]({% link en/corruption/secrecy-haven.md %}) is unwarranted. The law would then narrow down those members of the public to lawyers, resident in the country, who have filed a legal claim against the company.

The Foundation defines ready availability as information, including documents, that can be searched for, found and downloaded using a free, mainstream Web browser, anonymously, without payment and without having to register or log in, from anywhere in the world.
