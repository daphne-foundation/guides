title: Reverse due diligence
---

A company or person that performs due diligence, or instructs due diligence to be performed by an independent person or company, on themselves, is conducting **reverse due diligence**. They do this to mimic the steps taken by another party who would be performing a due diligence check on them in the future, in an attempt to mitigate any adverse findings before that point.
