title: Rule of law
---

The phrase 'rule of law' describes the legal, political, social and economic structures in a country that allow for a government to fulfil its duties to its citizens. 

Some examples of this include, protecting civilian rights, maintaining order and the functioning of the country. The core of the rule of law is to maintain an effective judicial system, which protects the rights of individual citizens.

## In the European Union

In the EU, the rule of law is enshrined Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union, which is protected by the European Commission. 

Following scandals including the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017 and [Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_J%C3%A1n_Kuciak) in 2018, the European Commission created a rule of law reporting mechanism that presents a summary of both the rule of law situation in the EU and an assessment of the situation in each member state [starting in 2020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0580&from=EN). The reports assess four pillars of the rule of law: the justice system, the anti-corruption framework, media pluralism, and other institutional checks and balances.
