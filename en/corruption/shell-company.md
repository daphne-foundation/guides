title: Shell company
---

A shell company is a company that only exists legally, and has no employees, offices or business activity. Shell companies that are incorporated in [offshore jurisdictions]({% link en/corruption/offshore-jurisdiction.md %}) are sometimes called [*offshore* shell companies]({% link en/corruption/offshore-company.md %}).

Owning a shell company is not illegal, but shell companies are often used for illegal activity, such as hiding money gained through illegal activity. Shell companies are often used in the [layering]({% link en/corruption/money-laundering.md %}) stage of money-laundering.
