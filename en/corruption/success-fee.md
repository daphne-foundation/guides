title: Success fee
---

A success fee is a type of payment made to an individual or business who advises on a business transaction. The payment is only made if the transaction is successful or if the client has reached the outcome they want. The success fee is therefore meant to be an incentive for the advisor to get the desired outcome. Success fees can be particularly vulnerable to corruption, especially in bidding processes.

A success fee is not always illegal. Lawyers may who are successful in winning their case may get a success fee.
