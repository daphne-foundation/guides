Tax havens are countries or places within countries with tax rules that allow people who live there and sometimes people who do not live there to pay little or no tax on anything they earn.

Tax havens require people to live there, at least [on paper]({% link en/corruption/on-paper.md %}), or companies to be registered there, so that they can benefit from the tax haven's low or no tax rules. A company that is registered in a tax haven is *domiciled* there and a person is either *domiciled* or *resident* in the tax haven.

Large corporations, especially multi-nationals, use [shell companies]({% link en/corruption/shell-company.md %}) in tax havens to appear as though the corporation is based there. Companies that use this trick include Apple and Starbucks.

In the past, wealthy people like singers, actors and race car drivers would physically move to tax havens like Switzerland and Monaco, to avoid paying tax in their home countries of the United Kingdom and France, for example. People and companies who exploit tax havens are now only [paper]({% link en/corruption/on-paper.md %}) residents of tax havens. This means that they have an official status of resident or domicile in the tax haven but do not live there and might sometimes only visit once a year for a few days. This has become possible because tax havens compete with each other to offer the least amount of regulation.

Tax havens that do not disclose information about who owns companies registered by them are also [secrecy havens]({% link en/corruption/secrecy-haven.md %}).
