A trust is a financial relationship between at least two people. One person, called a *settlor* or *trustor*, gives another person or group of people, called a *trustee* or *trustees*, the right to aminister somthing that they own. This could be land, a house, a bank balance or anything else of value. Anything gained from these assets, such as rent, interest or cash when they are sold, would be for the financial benefit of a *beneficiary* or multiple *beneficiaries* of the trust.

When trusts are set up for the purpose of money laundering, the beneficiary may be the settlor themselves or a family member of the settlor, who would secretly act on their behalf.

Trusts are not legal entities and have no legal personality. A trust can never *own* anything. It only formalises the relationship of someone administering something on behalf of somebody else, for the benefit of that person or another.

## Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi

Keith Schembri was both the settlor and the beneficiary of his trust set up in New Zealand, whereas Konrad Mizzi assigned both himself and his wife and children as beneficiaries.
