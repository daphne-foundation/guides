title: Warrant of prohibitory injunction
---

A warrant of prohibitory injunction is a kind of precautionary warrant, issued by a court, that disallows a debtor (someone who owes money to another person or company) from moving their property. This property must be specified in the application for the warrant by the person who has filed it. The reason that this warrant would be enforced is so that the debtor does not unfairly avoid a situation where they may have to give up his or hers assets in order to pay back a loan or the collateral amount agreed to on a loan. 

In Malta, a warrant of prohibitory injunction is known as a *mandat ta' inibizzjoni*. It is often confused with a [garnishee order]({% link en/corruption/garnishee-order.md %}) (*mandat ta' sekwestru*) and [warrant of seizure]({% link en/corruption/warrant-of-seizure.md %}) (*mandat ta' qbid*).
