title: Warrant of seizure
---

A **warrant of seizure** is a court order issued at the request of a creditor, ordering that a debtor's money or property is seized and paid to the creditor. If the warrant is *precautionary*, then the money or property is held by the court. If the creditor proves their claim, the warrant is converted into an *executive* warrant, and the debt is settled by transferring money or property held by the court to the creditor. If the claim is disproven, the property is transferred back to the owner.

In Malta, a warrant of seizure is known as a *mandat ta' qbid*. It is often confused with a [garnishee order]({% link en/corruption/garnishee-order.md %}) (*mandat ta' sekwestru*) and [warrant of prohibitory injunction]({% link en/corruption/warrant-of-prohibitory-injunction.md %}) (*mandat ta' inibizzjoni*).
