title: White-collar crime

A white-collar crime, as opposed to blue-collar crime, is usually defined as a non-violent crime, committed for financial gain. This definition is both contradictory and unhelpful. Financial crimes are committed by people of all economic classes and they often involve or lead to extreme violence.

There is no proven correlation between a person's class and their proclivity or ability to perpetrate premediated financial crime.

Daphne Caruana Galizia was assassinated in an attempt to stop her investigations into high-level corruption in Malta. Few other other kinds of crime involve a resort to such extreme violence.
