## Introduction

Is the best way to learn something by actually doing it, or by reading about it? It's a bit of both. We created this project to both document what we've learned — from what we've done — and help other journalists and activists.

## How to Contribute

There are many who don't need any lessons from us. If you're in that bracket, please, contribute your knowledge! We'd like to cover any topic that's useful to people working in journalism and advocacy. All pages of this website can be edited on GitHub and you can add new ones, too.

## The Guides

### [Reporting on Violence Against Women]({% link en/reporting-on/introduction.md %})

Our first guide, by Vjosa Isai. Aimed at reporters, this guide covers domestic violence, gender pay gaps, human trafficking, missing and murdered women, the representation of women in news, reproductive rights, sex work, sexual assault, orientation and violent online subcultures.
