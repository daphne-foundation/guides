## Introduction

Is the best way to learn something by actually doing it, or by reading about it? It's a bit of both. We created this project to both document what we've learned — from what we've done — and help other journalists and activists.

## How to Contribute

There are many who don't need any lessons from us. If you're in that bracket, please, contribute your knowledge! We'd like to cover any topic that's useful to people working in journalism and advocacy. All pages of this website can be edited on GitHub and you can add new ones, too.

## The Guides

### [Reporting on Violence Against Women]({% link en/reporting-on/introduction.md %})

Our first guide is by Vjosa Isai. Aimed at reporters, this guide provides an overview of topics related to violence against women, including human trafficking and sexual assault, examples of media coverage in Malta, and more. The Checklist chapter provides tips that reinforce a fair, ethical and victim-informed approach for reporting on violence against women.
