This is a complete checklist for reporting on everything covered in this guide.

## Preparation

**Do your homework.** As with any interview, advanced research and preparation are vital. Familiarize yourself with the local and global context of the issue. Some questions to ask yourself may include: 

 - What is the reputation, or documented evidence, of the local police force’s handling of sexual assault complainants? 
 - How prevalent are cases of domestic violence based on data available?
 - Are there data-collection gaps? 
 - How does the community that I am reporting on compare on this issue through a national, continental, or international perspective?
 - What intervention strategies are in place to help victims of human trafficking?   - What has research shown regarding why sexual assault complainants do not always report abuse when it happens? 
 - What are the common myths of rape culture, or other forms of violence against women? 
 - What does the law say? 

Building an awareness of the status of these conversations can help you ask questions related to systemic issues underpinning individual stories. But remember, every person and experience is different. 

**Demystify the interview process.** Most members of the public have never been interviewed by a journalist. For a victim of sexual abuse, apprehension for this new experience may be compounded by the fact that they are disclosing a traumatic or deeply personal moment. Take the time to walk your subject through what they can expect during an interview. 

**Let your source set ground rules if they need to.** Recognize that feeling a loss of control as a result of the abuse they experienced might make your source reluctant to speak to you for fear of ceding control over their story. Do your part in addressing their concerns, and remind your source that they can set boundaries of what you discuss as long as it does not conflict with your ethical duties as a reporter. Setting these ground rules may help your source feel more at ease, and gradually gain confidence to address more emotionally difficult aspects of their story. 

**Establish a time length.** If you have a limited amount of time to do the interview, communicate that with your subject and make it clear that you may ask for a follow-up meeting. Interrupting someone who is in the midst of describing a personal and painful story can be perceived as tactless and hurtful. 

**Stay out of earshot.** Ask your source to recommend an interview location, or suggest one that offers privacy for them to speak openly about their experience, without the risk of being overheard by others. It may help them feel more safe in discussing their story. 

## Interview

**Ask to record.** An audio recorder can be a valuable tool for documenting an interview, but it can also intimidate a vulnerable subject. Before you take out your recorder, describe what your intention is for the recording (such as for transcription purposes, broadcast audio, etc.). Answer their questions and seek their informed consent to being recorded. If your source’s case is before the courts or may be in the future, remember that recordings can be subpoenaed, and protect your documents accordingly. 

**Listen.** Interviewing is often seen as an art form because there is no prescriptive strategy or equation that will yield the same result in every scenario. There is an element of skill, resourcefulness, creativity, and practise required to become a proficient interviewer. The base attribute is to listen. Be non-judgemental. Be attentive.

**Stay sensitive and neutral.** It may be difficult to process the gravity of a sexual assault during an interview. Though the subject matter may be troubling to contend with, try to temper your personal reactions so as not to influence the direction of your subject’s response. Keep your focus on seeking their perspective. In its “Reporting on Sexual Violence” tip sheet, the DART Centre for Journalism and Trauma suggests acknowledging the challenging nature of the process with phrases such as, “I appreciate how difficult this is for you.” 

**Do not make assumptions.** Ask open-ended questions that allow the subject to fill in gaps on your understanding. Ensure that in framing your questions, you do not insinuate or suggest that the subject bears responsibility for the actions of the perpetrator. Doing so harmfully perpetuates common rape-culture myths. For example, what a woman chose to wear or whether she was drinking is not relevant to the fact that another person harmed her. 

**Review the terms of anonymity, confidentiality, and off-the-record agreements.** In any story, it is important to clearly define the terms of these types of agreements and explain how you will uphold your end. Your source also has a stake in this agreement. For example, off-the-record agreements are widely considered broken if a source lies, deliberately misleads a reporter, or otherwise acts in bad faith. This often means the terms that were agreed upon prior to the interview no longer exist. The reporter can use their discretion and ethical judgment on what to do with the information from the interview. (For a case study, read about how *The Washington Post* dealt with a [false account](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html) in 2017.)

**Establish professional boundaries.** During the reporting phase or following publication, a subject who perceives you as a ‘friend’ or trustworthy actor might seek you out for help, including for legal advice or financial assistance. Empathy is crucial for building healthy journalist-source relationships, but it is important that you adhere to your journalistic ethics. Refer your subject to community resources for help where possible, and underscore your professional role and boundaries. When in doubt, discuss with an editor. 

**Trust, but verify.** Where possible, ask the subject to provide documentation to corroborate timelines, allegations or other elements of their story – and of course, seek out your own verification methods. To the subject, this process may seem adversarial or appear to communicate a lack of confidence on the part of the journalist. Reassure your source that verification is a central part of your work, and is not a reflection of whether or not you trust their account. A document trail is another way for your subject to bolster their claims.

**Assess and communicate risks.** If the subject intends to share with you legally sensitive documents, including those related to a non-disclosure or settlement order, be sure that you break down the risks. Consult with your organization’s legal team, and urge the subject to seek their lawyer’s assessment as well. Though this may have a chilling effect on whether they give you permission to include evidence of certain documents in your story, it is more important that your subject fully understands and consents to the risks. Be sure that you keep a record that informed consent was provided. 

**Different rules apply when interviewing youth.** Parental permission is recommended, but each scenario has its own considerations (for example, if the parents are accused of domestic abuse). When in doubt, consult with your editor or an expert, and refer to online resources, such as this [Columbia Journalism Review guideline](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/kids-interview-journalism.php).

## Writing

**Be mindful about anonymity.** Many newsrooms grant anonymity to victims of sexual abuse because of the documented effects – including stigma, shame or re-traumatization – spurred by publishing their name. Refer to your newsroom’s naming policy, and when in doubt, consult with an editor. Ensure that your source is aware of, and consents to, the photos and descriptors you intend to use, such as age, hometown, profession, or others, and assess if these descriptions risk possible identification. Where an accused person or defendant is a relative, for example, their name could link back to your source. The failure to take such steps could expose your source’s identity and possibly re-traumatizing them. It could also damage your credibility. Consult with your source and editor, and use your judgment on whether to name this person. If it is helpful, develop a written framework or justification with your editor about how you came to the decision to name or not name your source. This may even be something you publish as a note to readers in addendum to your story. 

**Avoid gratuitous descriptions of assault.** Exercise your judgment and consult with an editor to confirm what details to include in your story. Pay attention to the balance of including enough information for readers to understand the nature and gravity of the assault. Details that are not relevant to providing this understanding can err into the graphic, voyeuristic or salacious, and can be harmful to your source and their account. 

**Be precise.** Language and active verb tense used to describe the abuse endured by women and girls who are sexually coerced, raped, non-consensually touched, and trafficked, among others, should reflect these circumstances. For example, in a case of alleged or proven rape, describing the incident as “non-consesnsual sex” omits the crucial language required to convey the violence of assault. When in doubt, refer to the criminal code or consult with experts.

In its [handbook for reporting on sexual violence](http://www.tricountywomenscentre.org/uploads/5/7/6/6/5766610/2013mediamanual.pdf), the United States-based Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault provides a useful table of terms, and phrases to avoid, when reporting on sexual violence.

Here is a sample:

| Problematic Language      | Alternate Suggestion in Judicial Reporting    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Fondled/groped            | Forcibly touched                              |
| Panties                   | Underwear or undergarments                    |
| Victim received oral sex  | Perpetrator forced mouth on victim’s genitals |

This guide also notes: “Much of this terminology implies consent. The problematic terms diminish the perpetrator’s dangerous behavior, making the acts seem sensual or pleasurable rather than criminal, harmful and forced upon the victim. Police reports should ensure that the language used is clinical and specific in nature.” Where police reports fail to do so, it is up to the reporter to treat the language responsibly.

**Be aware of your blind spots and bias.** Take the time to educate yourself about gender-based violence and women’s issues. Your personal experience interacting with these issues, or lack thereof, has likely informed part of your worldview. To achieve a broader perspective that will help you ask better questions and approach the issue from a more objective position, it is helpful to dismantle your preconceived notions. (For more, read about [*How Implicit Bias Works in Journalism*](https://niemanreports.org/articles/how-implicit-bias-works-in-journalism/) by Harvard Neiman Fellow Issac J. Bailey.)

**“Victim” and “survivor” are loaded words.** Take care to ask the subject if they have any objections with being addressed as a “victim” in your piece. If they opt for the term “survivor,” make it clear to readers that this is how the source identifies themself. Neutral words such as “complainant” can also be used.

**Where charges are pending, don’t convict.** According to [domestic violence reporting guidelines](https://www.osce.org/mission-in-kosovo/404348?download=true) published by the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe Mission in Kosovo, “It is extremely important that journalists take into account the human rights of the defendant, and the presumption of innocence is fundamental to this.” This rule generally applies to all types of crimes. Where a person is accused of a crime and has not been found guilty before the courts, be careful as to not convict them of that crime using your language choice. Words such as “alleged” or “accused” can help to convey the lack of a criminal conviction at the time. 

**Brief your source on what to expect in print.** Relinquishing editorial control through quote approval is not an ethically sound practise in journalism. However, when fact-checking your piece, you may consider summarizing sections of your story that feature your source and relaying it back to them over-the-phone to ensure you are accurately capturing their statements. Establish that the call is intended for fact-checking and verification of the context and your description of their story. Talking about the overall structure of your story can take some of the guesswork out of the equation for your source prior to publication and put them more at ease. 

## Publication

**Don’t make promises you can’t keep.** Remember that you cannot guarantee any outcome from your story being published to your source. But if you promise to contact your source when the story is published, or provide them with a copy, always follow through on your word. 

**Include links to community resources and services.** In raising awareness about violence against women through your reporting, in service of the public, it is also helpful to point to local community resources for your readers. We see this more often in stories about suicide, where mental health hotline numbers are often included at the bottom of a piece. In stories about an ongoing police investigation, it is also a standard practise to see the phone number of the local police force or lead investigator beneath the piece, in case members of the public have tips. The same thinking can apply to stories about violence against women. For example, Victim Support Malta provides free legal services to victims of rape and sexual assault. Raising the profile of this service offering beneath a story about sexual assault can be beneficial to readers. 

**Make yourself reachable.** Ensure your source has your most up-to-date contact information so they can get in touch with you as needed following publication. Include your email, office line, and social media links to encourage readers to get in touch as well, as this is a great means to generate story leads and tips. 

**Follow up.** Keep your finger on the pulse of the issue you’re writing about. Follow-up with your source, experts you have interviewed, police, policymakers, or any others you have quoted or documents you have referenced. Publication may signal the “end” of your reporting for that particular story, but often, it’s just the beginning.
