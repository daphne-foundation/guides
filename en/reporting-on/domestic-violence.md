Stories about domestic violence can continue to elevate this serious gender-based issue from being perceived as a personal or home-life matter, to a systemic and societal problem – in other words, not simply a “crime of passion,” as detailed in a 2019 Nieman Foundation [report](https://niemanreports.org/articles/domestic-violence-is-not-a-crime-of-passion/).

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), more than 87,000 women were killed in 2017. In its 2018 report called “Global Study on Homicide: Gender-related killing of women and girls”, UNODC found that 58 per cent, or 50,000 women and girls, were killed by intimate partners or family members. This translates to [137 women killed](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/GSH2018/GSH18_Gender-related_killing_of_women_and_girls.pdf) each day, worldwide. 

Persistent coverage in the media can serve to increase awareness and root out systemic or policy issues that intersect with domestic violence. For example, in the United States, research has shown that “at least 40 percent of police officer families experience domestic violence, in contrast to 10 percent of families in the general population,” according to the [National Center for Women and Policing](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/). Policy solutions to address increased violence in the households of law enforcement officers, whether it be additional funding for mental health programs for officers or resources for their families, can be explored through stories of the victims and elevate the profile of this issue through the media. 

But stories of intimate assaults can be difficult for victims to share, especially when the accused is a family member or spouse. This effect is compounded by the language surrounding sexual and domestic violence in various countries, as acts connected with “honour” or “shame”, and contribute to the stigma faced by victims. 

A 2018 Amnesty International [review of outdated rape legislation](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/11/women-across-europe-failed-by-outdated-rape-legislation/) in Europe notes that in Malta, prior to recent legislative amendments, “sexual offences fall under the chapter of 'crimes affecting the good order of families.’” Though the law has changed and no longer uses this language, the legacy of the ideas may still persist in the public’s perspective. As a reporter in Malta, it is important to be aware of this in your work and not perpetuate those ideas. 

## Malta at a glance

A 2012 survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [showed](https://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/survey-data-explorer-violence-against-women-survey) that more than 1 in 5 women in Malta (22 per cent) said they had experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner or a non-partner since the age of 15.
