Understanding what not to do in your reporting can be just as powerful as having a solid grasp of how to apply the tips in our checklist to your work. Below are two articles about the same 2018 case, the acquittal of Charles Fenech, followed by questions we encourage you to reflect on.

## Dont's

Follow along with the comments, that correspond with the *bold* text.

> # [Fr Charles Fenech acquitted of having sexually abused a woman](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/fr-charles-fenech-acquitted-of-having-sexually-abused-a-woman.689528)
> *Times of Malta*, 19 September 2018
>
> Fr Charles Fenech, the former director of the Kerygma Movement, has been acquitted of having sexually abused a vulnerable woman after an appeals court found that the relationship between the two was consensual **and the woman knew exactly what she was doing**.

This statement appears to blame the victim for this alleged sexual abuse. The burden of proof for a criminal charge was not met in this proceeding, and the reporter ought to break down why that legal threshold is more difficult in sexual assault cases and results in many legitimate allegations of abuse being deferred to civil court. However, if this remark is paraphrased from the court decision, it should be in quotation marks and cited as such, because of the editorialized nature of the statement.

> The priest was however **fined for having had sex with the woman in public places**.

He was found guilty of engaging in sexual activity in a public place. Simply stating that he was “fined” for something, and not stating the charge, gives the impression that it was a citation or something lesser than a criminal conviction.

> Fr Fenech, who had been [previously sentenced to three months imprisonment](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170810/local/fr-charles-fenech-convicted-of-indecent-assault.655349) suspended for a year, had his sentence revoked. He was however sentenced to a week's imprisonment, suspended for six months, for having had sex in a public place. He was also fined €500.
>
> Two appeals had been filed, one by Fr Fenech seeking acquittal, and one by the attorney general seeking a higher punishment. 
>
> Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera in a 61-page judgement said that it had not been proven that the Dominican priest had sexually assaulted the woman or that he had exploited her **because she had mental problems**.

Mental health is not a “mental problem.” The choice of language here is extremely inappropriate and further smears the victim, who is a vulnerable person given her condition.

> Although the two had had a relationship and met at various places for sex, there was **no doubt that the woman could stop the relationship whenever she wanted and the sex was consensual**.

It is not up to the reporter to prescribe whether or not there was “doubt” in the woman being capable of stopping the relationship. If the “no doubt” statement can be attributed to the judge, this statement needs to be in quotation marks and cited. Otherwise, it sounds to be the reporter’s editorialized take. Again, the burden of proof to convict of a sexual assault does not negate from the fact that sexual abuse underpinned the interaction. A person in a position of authority taking advantage of a vulnerable party are considerations here.

> **It was the woman herself who used to call for Fr Fenech in her car.**
>
> **Had she been so vulnerable, she would not have been the one to initiate action, but would have been on the defensive**, the court observed. **Yet she had even written in a glowing manner** to the priest in a Valentine's Day card. 

The use of language here is extremely troubling. Restating “the woman herself” and posing rhetorical questions such as “had she been so vulnerable” are damaging. Again, if this is attributable to a judge, it needs to be cited as such. Also, the woman is not on trial here. Pointing out the Valentine’s Day card without the context of where it fits into the evidence and how it introduces more complexity for the prosecutors defending the woman’s case would be more useful for readers, rather than a statement that sounds to be editorialized.

> The **woman had also denied everything when the issue was first reported** to the Curia.

It is well documented that victims of sexual abuse deny they were abused due to shame, self-blame and a host of other factors. If this reason was raised by a judge, it needs to be cited as such. It would be helpful for the reporter to have sought out an expert on trauma responses to contextualize the issue of why victims of abuse often retract their statements or fear coming forward with their allegations.

> The Church has stopped Fr Fenech from any pastoral role in Malta and Gozo.
>
> Lawyers Michae and Lucio Schriha and Franco Galea were legal counsel to Fr Fenech.

## Do's

Here is another article covering the same case. Keep an eye out for the differences.

> # [Appeals court overturns Fr Charles Fenech verdict; priest found guilty of having sex in public place](https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-09-19/local-news/Appeals-court-overturns-Fr-Charles-Fenech-verdict-priest-found-guilty-of-having-sex-in-public-place-6736196575)
> *Malta Independent*, 19 September 2018
>
> The Court of Appeal has overturned former Kerygma director Fr Charles Fenech’s guilty verdict for abusing a vulnerable woman, and reduced his sentence to one week in prison, suspended for six months.
>
> In August 2017, the Court of Magistrates had found Fenech, 58, from Rabat, guilty of attempted violent indecent assault of a woman in her 40s, who was working at the Dar tal-Providenza at the time.
> It had sentenced him to three months imprisonment, suspended for one year.
>
> But in a judgement delivered today, the appeals court, presided over by Judge Consuelo Scerri Herrera, revoked the Dominican friar’s sentence, finding that the prosecution did not bring forward the proof required by law that he had engaged in sexual activity by exploiting her vulnerability due to her mental illness.
>
> The court said that it was not a matter of contention that Fenech and the woman had an intimate relationship, with the two meeting in various places - including a convent and the woman’s home - to engage in sexual activity.
>
> However, the court said, it was also certain that the woman was able to put a stop to the meetings with Fenech when she so wanted.
>
> The sexual relationship between the two took place with their mutual consent, it said, with the woman having on numerous occasions picked the friar up using her own car, following which she would drive to different places to partake in amorous activity with him.
>
> “If she were so vulnerable, it wouldn’t have been her to instigate the actions,” the court remarked, “She would instead have been on the defensive, and not the initiator in the situation.”
>
> It also noted that, when her friends had reported the case to the Curia, the woman had denied the accusations in Fenech’s regard, since she hadn’t wanted to get him into trouble because of her.
>
> Although she was a vulnerable person, she knew exactly what she was doing, the court said.
>
> The appeals court, therefore, found Fenech not guilty of having abused the woman, revoking the first court’s judgement in this respect.
>
> It, however, found him guilty of engaging in sexual activity in a public place, and sentenced him to one week term in prison, suspended for six months.

## Reflection

 - What are some of the main differences between the *Malta Independent* and *Times of Malta* pieces?
 - How was the victim portrayed in either article? And the accused?
 - How are court documents referenced in both articles? Are they quoted or paraphrased, and how clear is it that this source material is used?
 - How is the ethical principle of fairness demonstrated in either piece?
 - How does each article contribute to the overall perception of sexual abuse victims and of those accused of sexual assault?
 - If you had to write a follow-up story using experts to provide context on sexual abuse trials,  what kinds of experts would you seek out? What would you ask them?
 - What would you do differently if you were reporting on this case?
