title: Gender pay gap and issues in the workplace
order: 8

The gender pay gap between women and men is now common knowledge thanks to the tireless work of academic researchers, advocates, and journalists examining the issue in their local communities or countries.

According to the European Commission’s [2017 report](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?doc_id=48063), the gender pay gap is about 10.6% in Malta, lower than the EU average of 16.3% (and the gap is defined as “the difference in average gross hourly wage between men and women across the economy”). Analysis and reporting on the gender parity and diversity of company boards and executives is an effective form of accountability journalism.

The #MeToo movement, cited in the section on [sexual assault]({% link en/reporting-on/sexual-assault.md %}), also saw hundreds of women come forward with sexual abuse and harassment allegations in the workplace. Here is a quick [reference to the legal definition](https://eige.europa.eu/gender-based-violence/regulatory-and-legal-framework/legal-definitions-in-the-eu/malta-sexual-harassment) of sexual harassment in Malta, published by the European Institute for Gender Equality.
