According to data compiled in a [2018 UNDOC report](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/glotip/2018/GLOTiP_2018_BOOK_web_small.pdf) on human trafficking, in 2016, 66 per cent of victims trafficked in Western and Southern Europe were victims of sexual exploitation. Another 27 per cent were trafficked for forced labour, and the remaining seven percent for other purposes.

Human trafficking intersects with many of the other types of violence against women, including domestic and sexual violence.

Ethical and security questions arise when interviewing women who have trafficked, such as considering the interviewer and subject’s safety, according to recommendations from the World Health Organization. “Having a sound understanding of the risks, ethical considerations, and the practical realities related to trafficking can help minimize the dangers and increase the likelihood that a woman will disclose relevant and accurate information,” the [2003 WHO guidelines](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42765/9241546255.pdf;jsessionid=A86D2AE8008297115AA62C18A6C04948?sequence=1) state.

## Malta at a glance

Efforts to curb human trafficking in Malta have come under scrutiny. Though more traffickers were prosecuted in 2019 compared to previous years, only one has been convicted since 2012 and then received a fully suspended jail sentence, according to a [US Department of State report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-trafficking-in-persons-report-2/malta/). Malta has also “identified fewer victims, continued to lack coordination among ministries, and did not effectively control licensing for massage parlors, where there was a high vulnerability for sex trafficking,” the report says.
