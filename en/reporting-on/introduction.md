Daphne Caruana Galizia, my mother, was the first woman to write a political column in Malta and the first columnist to write under her name rather than anonymously. Her readers asked whether her columns were really written by my grandfather or father. “Come on,” they used to say to her, in disbelief, “you can tell me.”

And those were the kind comments. From the moment that her first named column appeared in the Sunday Times of Malta in 1990, until her assassination in 2017, my mother was called a bitch, frustrated, menopausal, a whore, the Queen of Bile, and, most often, a witch (*saħħara*).

In one of her last court appearances, just months before she was assassinated, she felt she was at the “Salem witch trials,” as she wrote in her February 2017 commentary piece about the case. A cabinet minister and his aide had filed the libel suits after she revealed they shared a prostitute while on an official ministerial trip. The two men were represented by the same lawyer – “three archetypal Maltese misogynists,” she called them. 

As she sat there, listening to their lawyer “rant and rave against [her]” and “unable to stomach the revolting hypocrisy, the chauvinism, the misogyny, the freaky lies, the abuse and injustice,” she wondered: “Would they be saying this, in this tone and with this attitude, would they be saying these things specifically, if I were a man?”

My mother knew that underneath every mention of witch or whore lay a “simmering rage...the kind that all women who live in fear of their husbands, women who get hit, women who tiptoe around the house trying to keep the peace, immediately recognise.” Journalists know the power of words.

But before the words, she wrote, listen to the tone: “it seethes with savage hatred and anger, with contempt, and above all, with extreme irritation that a woman not only opens her mouth without stroking egos (or something else), but then won’t shut up.”

And what, in that court case, was their argument? It was the same argument, my mother said, that was always used against her in court. She summarised it as, “This evil woman is bad for society, dangerous to its senior male members, and must be put to death.”

Words, tone, and argument are integral tools in journalism. We trust this handbook will help journalists working in Malta think more deeply about how they report on violence against women.
