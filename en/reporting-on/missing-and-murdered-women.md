As noted in our section on [domestic violence]({% link en/reporting-on/domestic-violence.md %}), a global average of 137 women were [killed each day](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/GSH2018/GSH18_Gender-related_killing_of_women_and_girls.pdf) in 2017 by an intimate partner or a family member.

In typical murder cases where a suspect is apprehended by police, journalists can pursue many ongoing events to keep the story live, including reporting on the accused’s various court appearances or the police investigation. But what happens if the perpetrator kills their intimate partner or family member, and then takes their own life?  

It is important that journalists do not view domestic murder-suicides as dead-end stories. In the absence of a court process, there are still many reporting approaches that can bring these harrowing stories beyond a short, five-paragraph crime brief in the newspaper. 

For example, journalists can write profile pieces or features about the victim, interview family and friends, and get a sense of the life that was taken as a result of domestic violence. With regards to the killer, reporters can dig into any public crime records and establish whether the perpetrator had a history of domestic abuse, and if any previous arrests were made by police. Interviews with experts can also help contextualize the issue. 

To elevate the profile of violence against women – proportional to the degree in which it happens  – journalists should equally focus on stories where the person accused of the crime cannot face justice due to their suicide, unlike suspects in other types of homicides they may cover. This kind of journalism has incredible public service potential.

Another category of cases with often no criminal resolution, or a delayed one, are missing persons cases. Often, these stories are framed as a quick news brief , updated when the person is found. But when individuals are missing for an extended period of time, their stories can fall between cracks. 

In Canada, for example, a 2014 federal police report [found](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nine-things-to-know-about-the-national-inquiry-into-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women/article31654434/) that close to 1,200 homicides and long-term missing persons cases affected Indigenous women and girls between 1980 and 2012, with police attributing a “strong nexus to family violence” to the issue. However, an investigation from Canada’s national newspaper, The Globe and Mail, found the scope of this violence extends well beyond the household, and that “indigenous women are roughly seven times more likely to be slain by a serial killer than non-indigenous women.” The issue gripped the national conscience, with national and local outlets covering the stories of these women and systemic issues, including racism, the child welfare system, addiction and poverty that may have made them vulnerable to a killer’s path. The government later undertook a public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. 

## Malta at a glance

According to a September, 2019, report in The Times of Malta, about 359 missing persons cases over the last decade are [still active](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/nearly-70-maltese-are-still-missing-from-last-decade.732706). Of the missing people about 272 are reported as foreigners and 70 are Malta nationals. Vulnerable populations including migrants and refugees are also counted among the missing, and about a quarter of the still-missing people are women.
