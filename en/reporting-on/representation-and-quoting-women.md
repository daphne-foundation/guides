title: Representation and quoting women
order: 11

Quote women! Apply the same critical lens to the gender parity of your articles as you do to analysing it in other parts of society. To help you develop an awareness of this issue, try auditing your work for a diversity of sources, as science writer Ed Yong did in this [illuminating piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/) for *The Atlantic*. Women are typically underrepresented in the media. “When women do show up in the news, it is often as ‘eye candy,’ thus reinforcing women’s value as sources of visual pleasure rather than residing in the content of their views,” according to a 2016 peer-reviewed [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148434) in Public Library of Science (PLOS) One Journal.
