As one of the only countries in Europe with a strict and outright ban on abortion – even in cases of rape, incest, or when a woman’s health is at jeopardy – women and physicians in Malta who participate in abortion procedures can face up to three years of prison. (For an excellent recap of the landscape surrounding reproductive rights, read this 2019 article in The Atlantic, [*Malta’s fledgling movement for abortion rights*](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/maltas-abortion-rights/593845/).)

The case of a pregnant woman who was banned from travelling outside of Malta made headlines in September 2020, following a court order premised on her former partner's accusations that she was planning to seek an abortion in another country. The woman alleged she was a victim of domestic abuse. Mediating Women (see our section on [Do's and Dont's]({% link en/reporting-on/dos-and-donts-case-study.md %})) criticized how several Maltese media outlets framed the story with a victim-blaming narrative that omitted the perpetrator’s role in the apparent breach of her rights. A stock image of a pregnant woman in her third trimester appeared in the [Malta Independent](https://www.facebook.com/MediatingWomen/photos/a.217369612965916/371322094237333/) and [Times of Malta](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/abuse-victim-issued-travel-ban-as-partner-claims-she-wants-abortion.819991). “The headline places an emphasis on the victim not the perpetrator and the picture is NOT appropriate. Depict an abusive man not a faceless belly,” Mediating Women said in a Facebook post. Not only was this photo inappropriate, but it was also incorrect: The woman was 15 weeks along in her pregnancy, and not in her third trimester as the photo would suggest, underscoring how harmful careless stock imagery by news outlets can be to the public’s understanding of issues of abortion. 

Careless language use, such as accusing women of “killing an unborn baby” – in the oplace the more clinical terminology of “terminating a pregnancy” – is also damaging.
