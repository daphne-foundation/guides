As public debate continues over the legal status of sex work in Malta, reporters should seize this moment to deconstruct how they report on it. Here are four tips to consider:

## Human trafficking victim? Sex worker? ‘Prostitute’? 

Be mindful of your language choice. According to the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault, a [best practise](http://www.tricountywomenscentre.org/uploads/5/7/6/6/5766610/2013mediamanual.pdf) is to avoid using the word “prostitute” and instead say “prostituted [person]...as most adults and all children in prostitution are actually victims of someone else’s crime.” Ask your source how they identify themselves, and make this clear to readers in your reporting. 

## Do not use sexualized and de-contextualized images

Generic photos or stock-images – often pictures of a woman’s legs in fishnet stockings and mini-skirt, posing next to a car door and cropped from the waist down – perpetuate a caricature of sex work and must be avoided. According to the [Open Democracy guide](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/beyond-trafficking-and-slavery/guide-to-respectful-repo/) to respectful reporting and writing on sex work, these images “fail to portray the multiplicity and complexity of sex worker lives and reinforce negative stereotypes that sex workers are money-hungry alcoholics and drug addicts.” It is preferable to use photos that are more ambiguous, such as the photo of a silhouette of the back of your source’s head or blurred out face (and ensuring they are not identifiable), or other neutral photos.

## Do not ‘out’ your source as a sex worker if they wish to remain anonymous

Given the stigma surrounding sex work, your source may want to remain anonymous. Refer to the  Chapter 3 Checklist for Reporting on Gender-Based Violence, for more information on how to handle anonymity requests responsibly.

## Address ‘myths’ and biases in your reporting

RedTraSex, a group representing organizations of women sex workers in Latin America, has published a useful [guide for journalists](http://redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/guia_periodistas_disenada.pdf) reporting on sex work. The group says that myths, including that sex workers are a “neighbourhood nuisance,” “vector of infection” and of “evil, addiction and criminality,” are often perpetuated in reporting. Audit your work to ensure that you are not publishing harmful stereotypes.
