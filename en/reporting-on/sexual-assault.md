Reporting on sexual assault is a powerful form of accountability journalism. From uncovering mishandled police investigations to exposing patterns of abuse by powerful men, the work of journalists has proven to trigger policy changes, criminal investigations, calls to action, resignations, and other accountability measures. At the very minimum, this vital work makes the experiences of abused women a matter of public record – in many cases, where the perpetrators would prefer their stories remained shrouded in secrecy. 

Not only is this journalism a service to the public, but it also inspires other reporters to follow similar lines of inquiry in their own countries. This ripple effect was seen in the global response to the #MeToo movement, credited as a watershed moment that revealed the pervasive extent of sexual abuse across industries and institutions, and empowered women to come forward with their allegations. 

The #MeToo movement gained prominence following the reporting efforts of three American journalists – Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor of [**The New York Times**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html), and Ronan Farrow of [**The New Yorker**](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories) – whose 2017 investigations unearthed allegations by several women against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein, and demonstrated a pattern of sexual harrasment, sexual assault and cover-ups. He has since been criminally tried in court and, in February 2020, was sentenced to [23 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-sentencing.html) in prison for sex crimes. 

Institutions such as police forces have a key role to play in how sexual abuse cases make their way through the system, and into the public eye. In Canada, a 2017 investigation by Globe and Mail reporter Robyn Doolittle uncovered that, on average, police services across the country dismiss one in five sexual assault claims as [baseless](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/investigations/unfounded-sexual-assault-canada-main/article33891309/). These claims, deemed “unfounded,” are not pursued for further investigation based on the officer’s sometimes flawed or inconsistent assessment, and are therefore not captured in crime statistics, skewing the data relied on by policymakers. Among others, this investigation sparked internal reviews within several police forces across Canada and new guidelines for national data collection. 

Unquestionably, the upshot of this type of journalism is work that can meaningfully engage the public and inspire material change. The voices of those who have a story to tell are necessary to achieve this end.

## Malta at a glance

Police data has shown an increase in the number of cases related to a sexual offence in the last three years. In 2019, there were [145 cases](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Malta/Content/Detail/Report/2b719828-2ae5-4d03-888b-1891e972b154), an increase from the 120 cases in 2018. There were [102 cases](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Malta/Content/Detail/Report/d6da0d8b-ce89-4716-965c-15f4aeb4812d) in 2017. It is important to remember that these statistics only reflect the cases reported to police. Many sexual assault victims do not come forward due to stigma and self-blame, among other reasons, according to [research published](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/sexual-assault-report-why-research/) by the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Centre on Media, Politics and Public Policy. The article notes that in rape cases, a review of 28 academic studies found that many victims do not report their assaults because they are not aware it fits the legal definition of rape.
