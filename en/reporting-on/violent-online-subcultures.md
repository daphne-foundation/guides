In May, 2014, another tragic mass-killing rocked the United States, this time by a 22-year-old student, Elliot Rodger. He killed three students from the University of California, Santa Barbara – two of whom were his roommates – by stab wounds at their apartment, and three others were [shot outside a sorority house](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/us/shooting-victims-drawn-to-california-campus-from-near-and-from-far.html). Another fourteen people were injured in the rampage before Rodger turned the gun on himself. 

In addition to documenting his violent writings about women in an apparent manifesto, Rodger broadcast his crimes on YouTube. These digital records were seized upon by an online subculture known as “incels,” short for the “involuntarily celibate,” and referenced in [incel forums](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43892189). 

Four years later, in April, 2018, the “incel ideology” inspired a [copycat attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/alek-minassian-toronto-van-attack-interview-incels) in Canada, in which a driver plowed a rented van into pedestrians on busy north Toronto street. Alek Minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. The story captured international headlines and hundreds of articles profiling those killed and injured, the accused, and more on what preceded and followed the attacks. 

In May 2020, Canada’s federal police force announced a first-ever terrorism charge in connection to man accused of a homicide that investigators believe was driven by [incel ideology](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/incel-terrorism-massage-parlour-1.5575689). Law enforcement connecting incel violence to the realm of terrorism is just one of the signals of the danger, high risk and impact of this online community. 

Online forums are major breeding grounds for violence that is manifested in the real world. As seen in news reporting on mass shootings, for example, the online footprint leading up to the tragedy is an important part of the story. 

Though self-proclaimed incels involved in higher-profile activity resulting in violence in North America compared to Europe, the beliefs that underpin the incel community – from misogyny to femicide – can be found everywhere in the world. In Malta, it is important for journalists to remember and interrogate this angle in their reporting.
